# Dungeon Warfare 2 Map Editor
This project is a bit of a learning experiment for me, but hopefully someone will find this useful!\
There is no documentation provided by the game developers except a small example map found in the game directory:\
Dungeon Warfare 2\created_maps\example \

## Development goals:
This will probably happen in phases. I want to get basic editing functionality implemented before reworking some UI elements to improve the editing experience. \

### Basic Milestones
- Read input JSON file and display all values in a UI
- Allow simple, direct editing of all values
- Compile JSON file and allow user to download

### Future Enhancements
- Select a tile and click to paint on the map
- Preview for gates, rails, moving platforms
